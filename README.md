# Intro

This Memory Card Game has been forked from [this repository](https://github.com/saelsa/memory-card-game) and is currently being used as is, except for the following changes which I have already made:
* Images in the cards have been changed to include different topics (eg. Pictures from Peru)

In the following days I aim to keep changing the original game to personalise it to my own version. Some things that I aim to change are:
* Card sizes
* Allow for all the cards to remain visible once the user completes the game (current behaviour is that an "Outcome" pop up will appear while the cards rotate in the background)
* Website layout (eg. background colour)

### Play 

Either clone the project or [play online](https://scinana.github.io/memory-card-game/)

## Other info from the original README:

### Memory Card Game

Classic memory card game with eight pairs to match.

### How it works

Click on two cards, when they match they will stay visible. Otherwise they will turn around and you can try again. The game is over when all pairs are found. Stats will tell you how good you were. Isn't that motivating?
